üåê Deploying and Optimizing Guestbook App with Redis Memory Data Structure and Redundancy in OpenShift Internal Registry on Kubernetes 
üê≥ 1- Initial Deployment: Built and deployed a simple Guestbook application, an essential first step to get accustomed to deploying in a cloud environment.
 
- Deployment and Application Update:
‚Ä¢ Optimized Dockerfile for Guestbook app.
‚Ä¢ Pushed Guestbook image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.
- Autoscaling and Performance Management (HPA):
‚Ä¢ Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
‚Ä¢ Verified correct scaling based on demand.
- Rollout and Rollback:
‚Ä¢ Observed v2 Guestbook app post-deployment.
‚Ä¢ Successfully rolled back update when needed.
 
üõ†Ô∏è 2- Advanced Deployment with OpenShift: The most critical part of my project was deploying the Guestbook application from the OpenShift internal registry. This phase included:
 
‚Ä¢ Utilizing OpenShift image streams for seamless updates.
‚Ä¢ Deploying a multi-tier version of the application, enhancing the initial architecture with better data management and optimized performance.
‚Ä¢ Updating the application to ensure message persistence, significantly improving user experience.
